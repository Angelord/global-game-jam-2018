There are inconsistent line endings in the 'Assets/Wwise/Editor/WwiseWindows/TreeViewControl/TreeViewControl.cs' script. Some are Mac OS X (UNIX) and some are Windows.
This might lead to incorrect line numbers in stacktraces and compiler errors. Many text editors can fix this using Convert Line Endings menu commands.
